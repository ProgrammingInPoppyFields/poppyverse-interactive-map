OLDER PILOT is being asked a question. The question is the entire premise.
","
OLDER PILOT (CIA operative, jaded, over-qualified for every room she walks into) — wrestling with whether to opt in or out of something that is either an operation, a lifestyle, or a metaphysical commitment. The collision with you wannabe me (#54) suggests the question is personal.

Something was lost in translation. Something else was found.

OLDER PILOT (sans Google Translate — she has to do this the hard way, which is either impressive or a liability depending on the mission). The ultravioletverse's companion to lost in translation (#8). Different universe, different PILOT, same problem: meaning is slippery.

The author hopes you do. Really.

PILOT and DONOR — together here, where the multiverse thins out and the fourth wall starts to show its seams. DONOR is in her extra-dimensional ether form, which at this altitude is honestly just her natural state. This is as close to a direct address as the poppyverse gets.

All the PILOTs, from every fork and timeline and universe. No such thing as too many. Probably.
","
Every PILOT who has ever existed across the poppyverse — mundane and soldier and rusted and reincarnated and captain and commander and test pilot and ghost. They are all here. They are all her. The fourth wall is load-bearing and it is struggling.

PILOT is a neutron star. DONOR is a black hole. You're doing stellar, ladies.

PILOT (neutron star — dense, brilliant, the collapsed remnant of something that burned enormous) and DONOR (black hole — gravity incarnate, pulls everything in, technically invisible but you know exactly where she is; in hindsight this was always her most natural form).

Literally. The stars are screaming. Everybody's involved.
","
Everybody — all timelines, all iterations, all of them contributing to whatever is happening to the stars. Beyond the poppyverse is where scale stops being a concern and starts being the point.
